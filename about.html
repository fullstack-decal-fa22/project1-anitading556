        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3 class="aboutbox" style="font-family: Georgia Serif;">
            Hi! It's great to have you here reading this website I just made. I'm a sophomore studying computer science, and this site is one of the projects for my CS classes. 
        </h3>
        <h3 class="aboutbox" style="font-family: Georgia Serif;">
        You can see on the front page my brother's dog, me, and my 61B final project. Take a look at the game we made! It was a great experience, and you should take CS 61B as well :)
        </h3>

        <h3 class="aboutbox" style="font-family: Georgia Serif;">
            In the portfolio, I put some of the activities I am, or was interested in. 
        </h3>
        
        <h3 class="aboutbox" style="font-family: Georgia Serif;">
            Check it out! And if you feel like they appeal to you, hit me up! My contact information is embedded in the icon bubbles!
